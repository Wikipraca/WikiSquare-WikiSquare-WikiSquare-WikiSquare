# WikiSquare
"The *Wikipraça / WikiSquare* template is more than a template: it is a collective imaginary and a method. We decided to transform our site [Wikipraca.org](http://wikipraca.org/) in a template and release it in [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/). The Wikipraça project has built a participative method in Arouche Square, in the center of the city of São Paulo (Brazil). The method is a mixture of digital platforms, tools and collective mechanisms in physical space. We want every square, street, square or park in the planet to be shared and collective spaces. That is why we release the Wikipraça / Square template. At the same time, we open a global mailing list, to connect urban projects and wikisquares: the [Wikisquare](http://lists.wikipraca.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/wikisquare/) list.
This new multisite template, which enables to host multiple subsites within the same *Wikipraca / WikiSquare*, is a simple theme, but it gets embodied with the following plugins installed:
- [WP Design Maps & Places](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-design-maps-places/)
- [Network Posts Extended](https://wordpress.org/plugins/network-posts-extended/)
- [Meta Slider](https://wordpress.org/plugins/ml-slider/)

To create your *WikiSquare*, you just need to download the Wikipraça / WikiSquare template  and put it on your blog and / or server. If you are interested in hosting your wikisquare in [wikipraca.org](http://wikipraca.org/) platform, write us to wikipraca@riseup.net.

The project was developed by [Futura Media](http://futuramedia.net/) (São Paulo). We like free software and free culture. But in our organizational method me mix propietary and free tools.. Here you have a [text](http://wikipraca.org/faca-sua-wikipraca/)  (Portuguese), with our method. Please, remix it and adapt it to your necessities.
